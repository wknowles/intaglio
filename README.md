intaglio
===========================

An old style map made with Mapbox Studio Classic. I am hoping to emulate the look of old copper plate etchings. 

Data Sources:
* mapbox streets v6
* [Natural Earth 10M Graticules](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-graticules/) 1, 5, & 10
* [Natural Earth 10M Bathymetry](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-bathymetry/)
* [Natural Earth 10M Coastline](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-coastline/) - I used this in QGIS to create buffers for the waterlines (I would love to find a way to correct for distortion at high latitudes)

Currently a work in progress!
